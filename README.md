#### Description of project

ArrayToJSON is a CLI that takes an array of objects in a JSON file and converts it into multiple JSON files with the data of the individual object.

#### What problem does this solve

ArrayToJSON solved a problem I faced while converting a client's data from an array of objects to data that could be uploaded into MongoDB when I realized that each object had to have its own JSON file.

#### What problems did I face during this project

• Researching and creating a graphical interface so that the code was easier to use

• Creating filenames based on different properties in the object

#### Does the project work

Yes! ArrayToJSON does indeed work and can convert an array of objects into 100's of JSON files.

#### Self Usage

This project can be used by almost with basic javascript programming skills.
